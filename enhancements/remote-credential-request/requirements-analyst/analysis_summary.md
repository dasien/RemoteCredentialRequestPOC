# Requirements Analysis Summary: Remote Credential Access with PAKE Implementation

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the requirements analysis for extending the existing credential-request POC to support a remote/distributed architecture with actual PAKE (Password-Authenticated Key Exchange) protocol implementation.

**Project Type:** Educational/Learning Project
**Timeline:** Flexible - NO deadline pressure
**Primary Goal:** Learn and understand PAKE protocols through proper implementation
**Secondary Goal:** Demonstrate remote credential access pattern for stakeholders

### Critical Context

This is NOT a typical "build it fast" POC. This is an **educational project** where:
- **Quality over speed** - Take time to implement PAKE correctly
- **Learning is the goal** - Understanding PAKE is more important than quick delivery
- **No shortcuts** - Must implement actual PAKE protocol, not password hashing substitutes
- **Iteration expected** - Learning from implementation challenges is valuable

### Key Findings

✅ **Requirements are well-defined** - Source document is comprehensive and detailed
✅ **Building on solid foundation** - Existing POC is working and provides strong base
✅ **Clear educational objectives** - PAKE implementation goals are explicit
✅ **Favorable risk profile** - Flexible timeline and clear scope mitigate risks
✅ **Ready for architecture phase** - No blocking ambiguities identified

## Project Overview

### What We're Building

**Dual-Mode Credential Access System:**
1. **Local Mode (existing):** Agent directly accesses Bitwarden CLI in same process
2. **Remote Mode (new):** Agent requests credentials from separate approval server process using PAKE-secured communication

**Core Innovation:** Actual PAKE protocol implementation for secure agent pairing and credential delivery across process boundaries.

### User Story (High Level)

**As a** user with AI agents running on remote machines
**I want** those agents to securely request credentials from my local Bitwarden client using PAKE-based authentication
**So that** I can demonstrate production-ready distributed agent architecture with proper security

### Success Definition

**Technical Success:**
- ✅ Actual PAKE protocol implemented (SPAKE2, OPAQUE, or SRP)
- ✅ Both sides derive identical session keys without transmitting them
- ✅ Credentials encrypted with PAKE-derived keys
- ✅ Local mode continues working (backward compatibility)
- ✅ Agent successfully logs into aa.com using remotely-retrieved credentials

**Educational Success:**
- ✅ Team understands how PAKE protocols work
- ✅ Code demonstrates PAKE concepts clearly
- ✅ Implementation is correct, not just "good enough"
- ✅ Documentation explains PAKE learning points

## Requirements Summary

### Functional Requirements (8 Core Areas)

1. **Dual-Mode Operation** - System supports both local and remote modes via `--mode` flag
2. **PAKE-Based Pairing** - Agent and approval server execute actual PAKE protocol to establish shared session keys
3. **Approval Server** - Separate HTTP/WebSocket server handles credential requests
4. **Encrypted Communication** - All messages encrypted with PAKE-derived session keys
5. **User Approval UI** - Terminal-based UI for reviewing and approving credential requests
6. **Credential Delivery** - Approved credentials encrypted and delivered securely
7. **Session Management** - Sessions can be monitored, timed out, and revoked
8. **Backward Compatibility** - Existing local mode must continue working unchanged

**See:** `requirements_breakdown.md` for detailed functional requirements (FR-1 through FR-8)

### Non-Functional Requirements (6 Areas)

1. **Security** - PAKE protocol correctness, no credential exposure, session security
2. **Performance** - <5s credential roundtrip, <2s PAKE execution, <100ms encryption overhead
3. **Reliability** - Graceful error handling, automatic retry, clear error messages
4. **Usability** - Clear two-terminal setup, good documentation, actionable error messages
5. **Compatibility** - Python 3.8+, macOS/Linux/Windows, existing dependencies maintained
6. **Maintainability** - Clean code organization, comprehensive tests, inline documentation

**See:** `requirements_breakdown.md` for detailed non-functional requirements (NFR-1 through NFR-6)

### PAKE Requirements (CRITICAL)

These requirements define the core educational value and must NOT be compromised:

**MUST HAVE:**
- ✅ Implement actual PAKE protocol (SPAKE2, OPAQUE, SRP, or CPace)
- ✅ Use established PAKE library (python-spake2, pysrp, or opaque-cloudflare)
- ✅ Execute full PAKE message exchange between agent and server
- ✅ Both sides independently derive identical session keys
- ✅ Session keys NEVER transmitted over network
- ✅ Demonstrate mutual authentication property
- ✅ Pairing code used only for PAKE authentication (not transmitted)

**MUST NOT:**
- ❌ Use PBKDF2/scrypt/Argon2 alone (these are password hashing, not PAKE)
- ❌ Transmit derived keys over network
- ❌ "Simulate" PAKE with simpler crypto
- ❌ Skip PAKE message exchange protocol
- ❌ Cut corners under time pressure (there is no time pressure)

## Architecture Requirements

## Risk Assessment

### High-Priority Risks (Require Mitigation)

**RISK-T1: PAKE Implementation Complexity** (HIGH severity, MEDIUM probability)
- First-time PAKE implementation has learning curve
- **Mitigation:** Use python-spake2 library, allocate learning time, prototype early
- **Status:** ACCEPTABLE - Timeline flexibility mitigates this

**RISK-T3: Backward Compatibility Breakage** (HIGH severity, LOW probability)
- Risk of breaking existing local mode
- **Mitigation:** Strict regression testing, code isolation, no modifications to existing code
- **Status:** WELL MITIGATED - Preventable through testing

### Medium-Priority Risks

- RISK-T2: PAKE Library Selection - Create evaluation matrix, prototype candidates
- RISK-T4: Two-Process Testing - Build test infrastructure early
- RISK-S1/S2: Credential/Key Exposure - Logging discipline, code review
- RISK-I2: Network Reliability - Robust error handling, retries
- RISK-U1: Two-Terminal Confusion - Clear documentation, helper scripts

### Low-Priority Risks

- RISK-S3: Replay Attacks - Include nonce/timestamp validation in MVP
- RISK-E1: Learning Curve - ACCEPTABLE (timeline flexibility)
- RISK-P1: Scope Creep - Clear MVP definition prevents this

**See:** `risk_analysis.md` for comprehensive risk assessment with 15+ identified risks

## Constraints & Limitations

### Technical Constraints

- Must use Python (no additional languages)
- Must work with existing Bitwarden CLI approach
- Cannot modify existing local mode code paths
- **MUST implement actual PAKE protocol** (not password hashing)
- Localhost deployment only (no remote network required)

### Educational Constraints (Unique to This Project)

- **NO shortcuts** that bypass PAKE learning objective
- **NO "simplified simulation"** that skips key exchange
- **YES to extra time** for understanding PAKE correctly
- **YES to iteration** and experimentation
- **YES to extensive testing** of PAKE correctness

### Timeline Constraints

- **NO hard deadline** - quality over speed
- Take whatever time needed for proper PAKE implementation
- Learning from challenges is valuable (not wasted time)
- Building on existing POC reduces overall effort

### Out of Scope

Explicitly OUT of scope (do not attempt):
- Multi-user support
- Production-grade error recovery
- Actual remote deployment across networks
- GUI approval client
- Noise protocol on top of PAKE
- Browser extension
- Cloud deployment
- Forward secrecy (beyond basic PAKE)

## API Specification Summary

### Endpoints Required

1. **POST /pairing/initiate** - Agent requests pairing code
2. **POST /pairing/exchange** - Execute PAKE protocol message exchange
3. **POST /credential/request** - Agent requests credential (encrypted)
4. **POST /session/revoke** - User revokes session
5. **GET /session/status** - Agent checks session validity
6. **GET /health** - Server health check

**See:** `requirements_breakdown.md` sections "API Endpoints Specification" and "Message Encryption Specification" for complete details

## Gap Analysis & Open Questions

### Resolved Questions

The source document is comprehensive and resolves most questions. However, these decisions should be made by architect:

### Questions for Architect

1. **PAKE Library Selection:** python-spake2 (simple), pysrp (proven), or opaque-cloudflare (modern)?
   - **Recommendation:** python-spake2 for simplicity and educational value

2. **HTTP Framework:** Flask (simple) or FastAPI (async)?
   - **Recommendation:** Flask for simplicity, unless async strongly desired

3. **WebSocket Support:** Include in MVP or post-MVP?
   - **Recommendation:** Post-MVP (HTTP polling sufficient for POC)

4. **Session Persistence:** In-memory (simple) or file-based (survives restart)?
   - **Recommendation:** In-memory for MVP simplicity

5. **Pairing Code Format:** 6-digit numeric (user-friendly) or 8-char alphanumeric (more secure)?
   - **Recommendation:** 6-digit numeric (POC usability priority)

6. **Message Transport Details:** HTTP long-polling, short polling, or Server-Sent Events?
   - **Recommendation:** Short polling (2-second intervals) for simplicity

7. **Error Recovery Strategy:** How aggressive should retry logic be?
   - **Recommendation:** 3 retries with exponential backoff for transient errors

8. **Testing Infrastructure:** Best approach for two-process testing?
   - **Recommendation:** pytest fixtures with subprocess management

### No Blocking Ambiguities

All critical requirements are clear. Open questions are implementation details suitable for architect decision-making.

   - Encryption envelope format
   - Versioning strategy

### Design Principles to Follow

1. **PAKE First:** Design around PAKE protocol requirements, not the other way around
2. **Code Isolation:** Keep remote mode code separate from local mode
3. **Reuse Existing:** Maximize reuse of BitwardenCLI, SecureCredential, AuditLogger
4. **Educational Value:** Design should teach PAKE concepts through code structure
5. **Test-Driven:** Design with testing in mind (especially two-process testing)
6. **Clear Errors:** Every error should suggest corrective action

### What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don't design shortcuts around PAKE (defeats educational purpose)
- ❌ Don't modify existing local mode components (backward compatibility)
- ❌ Don't add features not in requirements (scope discipline)
- ❌ Don't optimize prematurely (POC correctness > performance)
- ❌ Don't skip PAKE protocol validation (security critical)

## Next Agent: Architect

**Handoff Status:** READY_FOR_DEVELOPMENT

**Architect Should:**
1. Read `requirements_breakdown.md` in detail (most comprehensive document)
2. Review `risk_analysis.md` high-priority risks (RISK-T1, RISK-T3)
3. Make technology selection decisions (PAKE library, HTTP framework)
4. Design PAKE integration (how PAKE fits into system)
5. Design API endpoints and message formats
6. Design component interfaces and interactions
7. Design error handling strategy
8. Design testing approach for two-process architecture
9. Create architecture diagrams (component, sequence, deployment)
10. Document architecture decisions with rationale

**Critical Architect Deliverable:**
- Clear design for PAKE protocol integration (message flow, key derivation, encryption)
- This is the core technical challenge and highest educational value

## Project Philosophy Reminder

**For All Downstream Agents:**

This is an educational project to learn PAKE protocols. When you encounter complexity or time pressure:

✅ **DO:**
- Take time to understand PAKE correctly
- Implement PAKE protocol properly (don't simulate)
- Test PAKE correctness thoroughly
- Document PAKE learning insights
- Ask questions about PAKE behavior
- Iterate until implementation is correct

❌ **DON'T:**
- Rush to complete quickly
- Substitute password hashing for PAKE
- Skip PAKE protocol message exchange
- Oversimplify for convenience
- Cut corners under imagined time pressure
- Treat as typical "build it fast" POC

**Remember:** The value is in learning PAKE, not in fast delivery. Quality and understanding are the success criteria.

## Conclusion

Requirements analysis is **COMPLETE** and **READY FOR DEVELOPMENT**.

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ Comprehensive, well-documented requirements
- ✅ Clear educational objectives
- ✅ Building on working POC (reduced risk)
- ✅ Flexible timeline (quality over speed)
- ✅ No blocking ambiguities
- ✅ Favorable risk profile

**Key Challenges:**
- ⚠️ PAKE implementation complexity (first time)
- ⚠️ Two-process testing infrastructure
- ⚠️ Maintaining backward compatibility

**Recommendation:** **PROCEED TO ARCHITECTURE PHASE**

The requirements are clear, scope is well-defined, risks are identified with mitigations, and no blockers exist. The architect has sufficient information to begin technical design, particularly the critical PAKE integration design.

**Status:** `READY_FOR_DEVELOPMENT`
