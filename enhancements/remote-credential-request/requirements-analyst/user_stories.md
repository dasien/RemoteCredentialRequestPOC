## Overview

This document contains user stories for the remote credential access enhancement. Stories are organized by theme and prioritized for implementation.

**Story Format:**
- **As a** [user role]
- **I want** [feature/capability]
- **So that** [business value/benefit]

**Priority Levels:**
- **P0 (MUST HAVE):** Required for MVP

## Theme 1: Dual-Mode Operation

### US-1.1: Run in Local Mode
**Priority:** P0 (MUST HAVE)
**Complexity:** Low (1 point)

**As a** developer testing the POC
**I want to** run the system in local mode with a simple flag
**So that** I can use the existing working POC without any changes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Running `python -m src.main --mode local` executes existing POC
- [ ] No new dependencies required for local mode
- [ ] All existing tests pass without modification
- [ ] Local mode performance is unchanged
- [ ] No network communication occurs in local mode
- [ ] Error messages appropriate for local mode

**Notes:**
- Must not break existing functionality
- Default behavior should be clearly documented
- Consider making local mode the default

---

### US-1.2: Run in Remote Mode
**Priority:** P0 (MUST HAVE)
**Complexity:** Medium (3 points)

**As a** developer demonstrating distributed architecture
**I want to** run the system in remote mode with a simple flag
**So that** I can showcase how agents and approval servers work across process boundaries

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Running `python -m src.main --mode remote` activates remote architecture
- [ ] Agent connects to approval server at specified URL
- [ ] Clear error if approval server not running
- [ ] Mode selection is explicit and documented
- [ ] Help text explains both modes
- [ ] Remote mode logs indicate network communication

**Notes:**

## Theme 2: PAKE-Based Pairing

### US-2.1: Generate Pairing Code
**Priority:** P0 (MUST HAVE)
**Complexity:** Low (1 point)

**As an** AI agent needing credential access

---

### US-2.2: Execute PAKE Protocol
**Priority:** P0 (MUST HAVE)
**Complexity:** High (5 points)

**As a** system implementing secure pairing
**I want to** execute an actual PAKE protocol during pairing

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Agent executes client-side PAKE protocol (SPAKE2, SRP, or OPAQUE)
- [ ] Server executes server-side PAKE protocol with same pairing code
- [ ] PAKE protocol messages exchanged over network
- [ ] Both sides independently derive identical session key
- [ ] Session key NEVER transmitted over network
- [ ] Protocol demonstrates mutual authentication
- [ ] Pairing code used only for PAKE authentication (not transmitted)
- [ ] Implementation uses established PAKE library (python-spake2 or similar)
- [ ] Tests validate both sides derive matching keys

**Educational Value:**
- This story delivers the core learning objective
- Team learns how PAKE actually works

- [ ] Session stores: agent_id, agent_name, PAKE-derived key, timestamps
- [ ] Session key derived from PAKE protocol (not hashed from password)
- [ ] Both agent and server have identical PAKE-derived keys
- [ ] Session logged (without exposing key value)
- [ ] Session timeout set to 30 minutes
