# Requirements Analysis Summary: AI Agent Credential Request System

## Executive Summary

This enhancement proposes a secure credential management system enabling AI agents to request and receive user credentials from Bitwarden with explicit human approval. The system allows agents to perform authenticated web tasks while maintaining user control over credential access.

**Scope**: Proof-of-concept (POC) demonstration focused on a flight booking agent accessing aa.com credentials through Bitwarden CLI integration.

**Status**: Requirements are well-defined and ready for architectural design. Multiple open questions require architectural decisions before implementation.

**Complexity Assessment**: HIGH
- Multi-agent architecture with inter-agent communication
- Security-critical credential handling requirements
- External system integration (Bitwarden CLI, web automation)
- Complex error handling and state management

**Estimated Development Timeline**: 8-10 days (as specified in source document)

---

## Open Questions Requiring Architectural Decisions

The source document identifies 8 open questions. I've analyzed each and provided guidance for the architect agent:

### OQ-1: Agent Architecture Pattern

**Question:** Should we use MultiAgentTemplate system or simpler direct approach?

**Analysis:**
- **Impact:** Affects entire project structure and agent communication
- **Trade-offs:**
  - MultiAgentTemplate: More complex, better scalability, standardized patterns
  - Direct approach: Simpler, faster development, sufficient for POC
- **Recommendation for Architect:** Evaluate MultiAgentTemplate overhead vs. POC timeline. If template adds >2 days, recommend direct approach with clear agent interfaces for future migration.

---

### OQ-2: Credential Passing Mechanism

**Question:** How should credentials pass between agents (direct call, message queue, shared memory)?

**Analysis:**
- **Options:**
  1. **Direct function call with return value (in-process)**: Simplest, Python object passing
  2. **Message queue with encrypted payload**: More complex, better isolation
  3. **Shared memory with access controls**: Complex, not needed for POC

- **Security Implications:**
  - Direct call: Credentials in same process memory, cleared by GC
  - Message queue: Credentials serialized (risk if queue persists)
  - Shared memory: Credentials accessible to multiple processes (higher risk)

- **Recommendation for Architect:** Favor direct function call for POC. Ensures credentials stay in-process, simplifies cleanup, reduces serialization risk. Document upgrade path to message queue for multi-process future.

---

### OQ-3: Vault Session Management

**Question:** Should vault be unlocked once per POC run or per credential request?

**Analysis:**
- **Per-request (unlock → retrieve → lock):**
  - ✅ Better security (minimal unlock duration)
  - ✅ Defense in depth (vault re-locked immediately)
  - ❌ Slower (user enters password each time)
  - ❌ Worse UX for multiple requests

- **Per-session (unlock once, multiple requests):**
  - ✅ Better UX (password once)
  - ✅ Faster for multiple credentials
  - ❌ Vault stays unlocked longer (security risk)
  - ❌ Requires session timeout management

- **Recommendation for Architect:** Implement per-request for MVP (better security for POC). Add "session mode" as "should have" feature with configurable timeout. Document security trade-offs clearly.

---

### OQ-4: Password Storage During Session

**Question:** Should vault password be kept in memory for session duration or re-prompted each time?

**Analysis:**
- **Never store (re-prompt each time):**
  - ✅ Maximum security (password exists briefly)
  - ❌ Poor UX (repetitive for user)

- **Store for session:**
  - ✅ Better UX
  - ❌ Password in memory longer (attack surface)
  - ❌ Requires secure clearing on exit

- **Recommendation for Architect:** Re-prompt for MVP (aligns with per-request locking). If session mode added later, store password only during session with secure clearing. Never persist password beyond session.

---

### OQ-5: Login Failure Recovery

**Question:** If browser login fails with credentials, should agent request credentials again or abort?

**Analysis:**
- **Scenarios for login failure:**
  1. Wrong credentials in vault (user's vault issue)
  2. Website changed login flow (POC issue)
  3. Network error (transient)
  4. Credential worked but 2FA required (out of scope)

- **Options:**
  1. **Abort immediately:** Simplest, puts burden on user to fix vault
  2. **Retry credential request:** Could annoy user, might get same wrong credential
  3. **Report specific error and let user decide:** Best UX

- **Recommendation for Architect:** Abort on login failure with clear error message. Log the failure for debugging. Do NOT retry credential request automatically (user likely gave correct vault credential - issue is elsewhere). Provide error details to help user diagnose (wrong username/password vs. website changed vs. network issue).

---

### OQ-6: Testing Credentials Strategy

**Question:** Should we use real Bitwarden vault with test credentials or mock CLI interface?

**Analysis:**
- **Real vault with test credentials:**
  - ✅ End-to-end integration testing
  - ✅ Validates actual CLI behavior
  - ✅ Tests CLI error handling
  - ❌ Requires Bitwarden setup for testing
  - ❌ Tests depend on external service

- **Mock CLI interface:**
  - ✅ Fast unit tests
  - ✅ No external dependencies
  - ✅ Easy to test error scenarios
  - ❌ May not catch CLI quirks
  - ❌ Doesn't validate actual integration

- **Recommendation for Architect:** Use BOTH approaches:
  - Mock CLI for unit tests (fast feedback, error scenarios)
  - Real vault for integration tests (validates end-to-end)
  - Document test vault setup in README
  - Use test credentials like `test-user@example.com` / `TestPass123!`

---

### OQ-7: Browser Visibility Mode

**Question:** Should browser run in headed mode (visible) or headless for POC demonstration?

**Analysis:**
- **Headed (visible) mode:**
  - ✅ User sees what's happening (transparency)
  - ✅ Easier debugging during development
  - ✅ Better for POC demonstration
  - ❌ Requires display (not ideal for servers)

- **Headless mode:**
  - ✅ Faster execution
  - ✅ Works on servers without display
  - ❌ User can't see what agent is doing
  - ❌ Harder to debug

- **Recommendation for Architect:** Make it configurable with CLI flag (--headless). Default to headed mode for POC demonstration (visibility builds trust). Document both modes in README. Consider headed for demo, headless for automated testing.

---

### OQ-8: Credential Matching Strategy

**Question:** How should system match agent's domain request to vault items (exact match, wildcard, fuzzy)?

**Analysis:**
- **Exact domain match (aa.com == aa.com):**
  - ✅ Simple and predictable
  - ✅ No ambiguity
  - ❌ Fails if user stored "www.aa.com" instead of "aa.com"
  - ❌ Fails if subdomain differs

- **Fuzzy match (aa.com matches www.aa.com, login.aa.com):**
  - ✅ More flexible (works with subdomains)
  - ✅ Better UX (user doesn't need exact match)
  - ❌ More complex logic
  - ❌ Could match wrong credential (api.aa.com vs aa.com)

- **Bitwarden CLI built-in matching:**
  - `bw get item <domain>` - Uses Bitwarden's own matching logic
  - Handles URI matching, wildcards, etc.
  - Delegates complexity to Bitwarden

- **Recommendation for Architect:** Use Bitwarden CLI's built-in matching (`bw get item aa.com` or `bw list items --search aa.com`). Leverage Bitwarden's URI matching logic rather than reimplementing. Document that credentials should be stored with URI field matching the domain. If multiple matches found, return first match or prompt user to select.

## Technical Constraints and Risks

### Hard Constraints (Cannot Change)

**CNS-1: Bitwarden CLI Limitations**
- Cannot modify Bitwarden's CLI or API behavior
- Subject to CLI rate limits (if any)
- Must parse CLI output (JSON format may change)
- Depends on user having Bitwarden subscription and CLI access

**CNS-2: Python Garbage Collection**
- Cannot force immediate memory deallocation
- Python's GC may delay clearing of credential objects
- References in exception tracebacks may persist credentials
- Mitigation: Overwrite credential strings before relying on GC

**CNS-3: Browser Automation Limitations**
- Website may change HTML structure (breaks selectors)
- Website may implement bot detection (blocks automation)
- Network latency affects timing of element detection
- JavaScript-heavy sites require waiting for dynamic content

**CNS-4: POC Scope Boundaries**
- Single-user, single-machine deployment only
- No enterprise features (policy enforcement, admin approval)
- No production-grade error recovery
- No performance optimization or scalability concerns

### Security Risks

**RISK-1: Credential Exposure in Memory (HIGH)**
- **Description:** Credentials stored as Python strings exist in memory until GC runs
- **Impact:** Memory dump or debugger attachment could expose credentials
- **Mitigation:** Overwrite strings explicitly, clear variables in finally blocks, minimal credential lifetime
- **Residual Risk:** Python doesn't guarantee immediate memory clearing

**RISK-2: Credential Leakage in Logs/Tracebacks (HIGH)**
- **Description:** Logging or exception handlers might accidentally output credentials
- **Impact:** Credentials written to disk in log files or console history
- **Mitigation:** Never log credential objects, sanitize all log messages, careful exception handling
- **Residual Risk:** Developer error could introduce logging in future

**RISK-3: Vault Left Unlocked (MEDIUM)**
- **Description:** Exception or crash might leave vault unlocked
- **Impact:** Other processes could access unlocked vault
- **Mitigation:** Use try/finally blocks, lock vault in finally, test exception paths
- **Residual Risk:** Hard crash (kill -9) might prevent finally block execution

**RISK-4: Bitwarden CLI Output Parsing (MEDIUM)**
- **Description:** CLI output format might change in updates
- **Impact:** Credential extraction fails, POC breaks
- **Mitigation:** Parse JSON output (stable), validate structure, graceful failure on parse errors
- **Residual Risk:** Breaking changes in CLI updates

**RISK-5: Browser Automation Detection (LOW for POC)**
- **Description:** Websites may detect Playwright and block automation
- **Impact:** Login fails even with correct credentials
- **Mitigation:** Use stealth mode, realistic user-agent, human-like delays
- **Residual Risk:** Sophisticated detection may still block; acceptable for POC

**RISK-6: Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (LOW for POC)**
- **Description:** Network traffic between browser and aa.com could be intercepted
- **Impact:** Credentials exposed over network
- **Mitigation:** HTTPS enforced by browser, validate SSL certificates
- **Residual Risk:** Compromised CA or local proxy; acceptable for POC

### Technical Risks

**RISK-7: Browser Timing Issues (MEDIUM)**
- **Description:** Login page elements may not load before agent tries to fill form
- **Impact:** Form filling fails, login doesn't complete
- **Mitigation:** Use Playwright's wait_for_selector with timeouts, retry logic
- **Residual Risk:** Slow networks or website changes may still cause failures

**RISK-8: Bitwarden CLI Session Management (MEDIUM)**
- **Description:** CLI session handling may be complex (session keys, timeouts)
- **Impact:** Vault operations fail unexpectedly
- **Mitigation:** Test session expiration scenarios, implement session validation
- **Residual Risk:** Undocumented CLI behavior may cause issues

**RISK-9: Error Handling Complexity (MEDIUM)**
- **Description:** Many failure modes across multiple components
- **Impact:** Poor error messages, unclear user guidance
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive error mapping, user-friendly messages, testing all error paths
- **Residual Risk:** Unanticipated error conditions may have poor handling

**RISK-10: Python Async/Await Complexity (LOW)**
- **Description:** Playwright requires async/await, mixing with sync code is complex
- **Impact:** Development difficulty, potential deadlocks
- **Mitigation:** Use asyncio.run() properly, test async flows, clear documentation
- **Residual Risk:** Developer unfamiliarity with async patterns

## Recommendations for Architect Agent

### Critical Architectural Decisions Required

**AD-1: Agent Communication Pattern**
- **Decision Needed:** Direct function calls vs. message queue vs. other
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (affects entire design)
- **Guidance:** Recommend direct function calls for POC simplicity, document upgrade path
- **Trade-offs:** See OQ-2 analysis above

**AD-2: Credential Passing Mechanism**
- **Decision Needed:** Python object reference vs. serialized data vs. shared memory
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (affects security)
- **Guidance:** Python object reference with context manager for automatic cleanup
- **Trade-offs:** Simple and secure for in-process agents, harder to scale to multi-process

**AD-3: Error Handling Strategy**
- **Decision Needed:** Exception-based vs. result objects vs. hybrid
- **Priority:** HIGH (affects reliability)
- **Guidance:** Use exceptions for unexpected errors, result objects for expected failures (user denial, missing credential)
- **Recommendation:** Create CredentialResponse dataclass with status enum (approved/denied/error)

**AD-4: Session Management Strategy**
- **Decision Needed:** Per-request locking vs. session-based unlocking
- **Priority:** HIGH (affects security and UX)
- **Guidance:** Implement per-request for MVP, design for session upgrade
- **Recommendation:** See OQ-3 and OQ-4 analysis above

**AD-5: Testing Strategy**
- **Decision Needed:** Real vault vs. mocked CLI vs. both
- **Priority:** MEDIUM (affects development workflow)
- **Guidance:** Both approaches (see OQ-6 analysis)
- **Recommendation:** Unit tests with mocks, integration tests with real vault

### Design Patterns to Consider

**DP-1: Context Manager for Vault Operations**
```python
with BitwardenVault(password) as vault:
    credential = vault.get_credential("aa.com")
    # Vault automatically locked on exit, even if exception
```
- **Benefit:** Guaranteed vault locking, clean syntax, exception-safe

**DP-2: Credential Context Manager**
```python
with credential_manager.get_credential("aa.com") as cred:
    browser.login(cred.username, cred.password)
    # Credential automatically cleared on exit
```
- **Benefit:** Guaranteed credential clearing, limited lifetime, exception-safe

**DP-3: Agent Protocol/Interface**
- Define abstract base class for agents
- Standardize request/response message formats
- Enable future agent additions without changing orchestrator
- **Benefit:** Extensibility, testability, clear contracts

**DP-4: Command Pattern for Agent Actions**
- Encapsulate agent requests as command objects
- Support undo/retry/logging consistently
- **Benefit:** Audit trail, error recovery, testability

### Non-Functional Requirements to Address

**NFR-7: Extensibility**
- While POC targets single domain (aa.com), design should not hardcode domain
- Agent should accept domain as parameter, not constant
- Support future addition of multiple domain requests
- **Architecture Implication:** Credential request takes domain as parameter, not inferred

**NFR-8: Testability**
- All components should be testable in isolation
- External dependencies (CLI, browser) should be mockable
- **Architecture Implication:** Dependency injection for CLI wrapper and browser instances

**NFR-9: Observability**
- User should see progress at each step (unlocking, searching, logging in)
- Clear indication of which agent is active
- **Architecture Implication:** Status callback or progress reporting mechanism

**NFR-10: Configurability**
- Browser headless mode configurable via CLI flag
- Vault timeout configurable
- Retry attempts configurable
- **Architecture Implication:** Configuration object or CLI argument parser

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Security Risk Mitigation

**M-1: Prevent Credential Logging**
- Implement custom logging filter to block credential objects
- Create SecureString class that masks __repr__/__str__
- Code review checklist: No f-strings or print() with credential variables
- Automated test: Parse all logs and fail if pattern matches credential format

**M-2: Ensure Vault Locking**
- Use try/finally pattern consistently
- Create VaultContext context manager
- Automated test: Check `bw status` after each integration test
- Manual test: Kill process during unlock, verify vault state

**M-3: Clear Credentials from Memory**
- Overwrite credential strings before del
- Use __del__ method on SecureCredential class
- Clear variables in finally blocks
- Document: Python GC doesn't guarantee immediate clearing (best-effort)

### Technical Risk Mitigation

**M-4: Browser Timing Reliability**
- Use Playwright's wait_for_selector with generous timeouts
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Add explicit wait for network idle before interacting
- Fallback to screenshots on failure for debugging

**M-5: CLI Output Parsing Robustness**
- Parse JSON output (more stable than text parsing)
- Validate JSON structure before accessing fields
- Graceful degradation on parse errors
- Log raw CLI output (without credentials) for debugging

**M-6: Comprehensive Error Handling**
- Map each subprocess error code to user-friendly message
- Provide actionable guidance for each error type
- Test all error paths during integration testing
- Document known errors and recovery steps in README

## Assumptions and Constraints Documentation

### Assumptions Made During Analysis

**A-1: User Environment**
- Assumption: User has Python 3.8+ installed
- Assumption: User has working internet connection
- Assumption: User has Bitwarden account with CLI access (not free account limitations)
- Assumption: User's machine can run Chromium browser (sufficient resources)
- **Impact if Wrong:** POC won't run, requires setup documentation to be clear

**A-2: Bitwarden Vault State**
- Assumption: User has credential for aa.com stored in vault
- Assumption: Credential includes username and password fields
- Assumption: Credential URI field matches "aa.com" (exact or fuzzy)
- **Impact if Wrong:** Missing credential error, user must add credential

**A-3: Website Stability**
- Assumption: aa.com login page structure remains stable during POC development
- Assumption: aa.com allows automated login (no strict bot detection)
- Assumption: aa.com uses standard HTML form (not OAuth redirect or SSO)
- **Impact if Wrong:** Login automation may fail, requires selector updates

**A-4: POC Scope**
- Assumption: POC demonstrates credential flow, not complete flight booking
- Assumption: Security is POC-level, not production-grade
- Assumption: Single-user, single-credential scenario only
- Assumption: No 2FA or MFA handling required
- **Impact if Wrong:** Scope expansion, timeline increase

### Constraints Acknowledged

**C-1: Timeline Constraint**
- 8-10 days development time (firm)
- Must prioritize MVP over nice-to-have features
- Limited time for polish or edge case handling

**C-2: Technology Constraint**
- Must use Bitwarden CLI (no custom credential management)
- Must use Playwright (specified for browser automation)
- Must use Python 3.8+ (specified in source)

**C-3: Security Constraint**
- Cannot use production secrets for testing (requires test vault)
- Cannot weaken security for convenience (no credential persistence trade-off)
- Must maintain audit trail (compliance/accountability)

**C-4: Resource Constraint**
- Single developer (assumed)
- No dedicated QA or security review (developer self-tests)
- No CI/CD pipeline (manual testing)

## Next Steps for Architecture Phase

The architect agent should focus on these priorities:

### Priority 1: Resolve Open Questions (OQ-1 through OQ-8)
- Decision on agent architecture pattern
- Design credential passing mechanism
- Define vault session management strategy
- Specify credential matching algorithm

### Priority 2: Design System Architecture
- Component diagram with clear boundaries
- Data flow diagram showing credential lifecycle
- Error handling flow diagram
- Sequence diagram for happy path

### Priority 3: Define Agent Interfaces
- CredentialRequest message format (dataclass definition)
- CredentialResponse message format (dataclass definition)
- Agent protocol/interface (ABC or protocol class)
- Credential handler API (context manager interface)

### Priority 4: Security Architecture
- Credential lifecycle diagram (birth to death)
- Memory management strategy (when/how to clear)
- Logging architecture (what to log, what to never log)
- Exception handling architecture (credential clearing in error paths)

### Priority 5: Technical Specifications
- File structure and module organization
- Bitwarden CLI command specifications (exact commands to run)
- Playwright selector strategy (resilient selectors for aa.com)
- Configuration management approach (CLI args, config file, env vars)
