## Security Risks

### RISK-S1: Credential Exposure in Memory Dumps

**Category:** Security - Credential Leakage
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (25-50%)
**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Risk Priority:** HIGH

**Description:**
Python stores strings in memory until garbage collection. A memory dump (via debugger, crash dump, or process inspection) could expose credentials even after they're "cleared."

**Attack Vectors:**
- Debugger attached to Python process
- Core dump generated on crash
- Process memory scanning by malware
- Memory swap to disk (virtual memory)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **String Overwriting (Implemented):**
   - Overwrite credential strings with 'X' characters before deletion
   - Use `credential_str = 'X' * len(credential_str)` pattern
   - **Effectiveness:** Reduces exposure window but doesn't guarantee memory clearing

2. **Immediate Clearing (Implemented):**
   - Clear credentials immediately after use (not batched)
   - Use context managers for automatic clearing
   - Call clear() in finally blocks
   - **Effectiveness:** Minimizes time credentials exist in memory

3. **Minimal Credential Lifetime (Implemented):**
   - Keep credentials in memory <60 seconds
   - No credential caching or reuse
   - Per-request vault unlocking
   - **Effectiveness:** Reduces attack window

4. **Process Isolation (Not Implemented - Out of Scope):**
   - Run credential handling in separate process
   - Use IPC with encrypted channels
   - **Effectiveness:** Better isolation but complex for POC

**Residual Risk:** MEDIUM
- Python GC timing is non-deterministic
- Python doesn't provide memory wiping primitives
- Attack requires privileged access to process memory
- Acceptable for POC, not for production

**Monitoring/Detection:**
- Review code for credential lifetime
- Measure time from credential creation to clearing
- Memory profiling (if tools available)

### RISK-S2: Credential Leakage in Logs

**Category:** Security - Credential Leakage
**Likelihood:** HIGH (50-75%) without mitigation
**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Risk Priority:** CRITICAL

**Description:**
Accidental logging of credential objects or values could expose sensitive data in log files, which are often stored long-term and accessible to multiple parties.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Developer uses print() or logger.info() with credential object
- Exception traceback includes credential variable values
- Debugging statements left in production code
- Log aggregation systems storing logs long-term

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Credential Object Safety (Implemented):**
   - Override __repr__ and __str__ to return "[REDACTED]"
   - Prevent credential values from appearing in string conversions
   - **Effectiveness:** Prevents accidental logging via print/logger

2. **Logging Best Practices (Implemented):**
   - Never pass credential objects to logging functions
   - Log only metadata (domain, agent_id, success/failure)
   - Use structured logging to separate sensitive from non-sensitive
   - **Effectiveness:** Requires developer discipline

3. **Code Review Checklist (Recommended):**
   - Review all logging statements before commit
   - Search codebase for logger.*/print.* with credential variables
   - Automated linting rule to detect credential logging
   - **Effectiveness:** Catches issues before deployment

4. **Automated Testing (Implemented):**
   - After each test, grep logs for test credential values
   - Fail test if credential found in logs
   - **Effectiveness:** Catches leaks during testing

**Residual Risk:** LOW (with mitigations)
- Requires developer error to introduce leak
- Automated tests catch most leaks
- Code review provides additional safety net

**Monitoring/Detection:**
- Automated log scanning for credential patterns
- Regular security audits of log files
- Grep test: `grep -r "TestPass123" logs/` (should be zero)

### RISK-S3: Vault Left Unlocked After Exception

**Category:** Security - Access Control
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (25-50%)
**Impact:** HIGH
**Risk Priority:** HIGH

**Description:**
If an exception occurs during credential retrieval and vault locking is not exception-safe, vault could remain unlocked, allowing other processes to access it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Other processes on same machine access unlocked vault
- Malware reads credentials from unlocked vault
- User forgets vault is unlocked and leaves machine unattended

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Finally Blocks (Implemented):**
   - Wrap vault unlock in try/finally
   - Call bw lock in finally block
   - Ensures lock even on exception
   - **Effectiveness:** Handles most exception scenarios

2. **Context Manager Pattern (Recommended):**
   ```python
   with BitwardenVault(password) as vault:
       credential = vault.get_credential(domain)
       # Vault auto-locks on context exit
   ```
   - **Effectiveness:** Idiomatic Python, hard to misuse

3. **Vault Status Verification (Testing):**
   - After each test, verify `bw status` shows locked
   - Fail test if vault unlocked
   - **Effectiveness:** Catches lock failures during testing

4. **Multiple Lock Attempts (Implemented):**
   - Lock vault in multiple places (defense in depth)
   - Lock in finally block of retrieval function
   - Lock in cleanup function of orchestrator
   - **Effectiveness:** Increases chance of locking even if one fails

**Residual Risk:** LOW (with mitigations)
- Hard crash (kill -9) may prevent finally block execution
- OS crash won't run cleanup code
- Bitwarden vault auto-locks on timeout (fallback)

**Monitoring/Detection:**
- Regular vault status checks during execution
- Alert if vault remains unlocked >5 minutes
- Test all exception paths to verify locking

---

### RISK-S4: Vault Password Exposure

**Category:** Security - Credential Leakage
**Likelihood:** LOW (10-25%)
**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Risk Priority:** MEDIUM

**Description:**
Vault master password is even more sensitive than individual credentials. Exposure could compromise entire vault.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Password passed via command-line arguments (visible in ps)
- Password stored in environment variable
- Password logged during debugging
- Password in exception traceback

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Secure Input Collection (Implemented):**
   - Use getpass.getpass() for password input
   - No echo to terminal
   - No command-line password arguments
   - **Effectiveness:** Prevents most exposure vectors

2. **Immediate Password Clearing (Implemented):**
   - Clear password variable immediately after unlock
   - Don't store password for session duration
   - Overwrite password string before deletion
   - **Effectiveness:** Minimizes exposure window

3. **CLI Input Method (Implemented):**
   - Use `bw unlock <password> --raw` (password as arg to unlock)
   - Alternative: stdin input to avoid process args
   - Session key used for subsequent operations
   - **Effectiveness:** Password not visible in process list long-term

4. **No Password Storage (Implemented):**
   - Re-prompt for password on each request
   - Don't cache password for session
   - User controls password lifetime
   - **Effectiveness:** Minimizes risk at cost of UX

**Residual Risk:** LOW
- Password briefly visible in process arguments during unlock
- Attack requires perfect timing to capture from ps output
- Acceptable for POC, consider stdin input for production

**Monitoring/Detection:**
- Never log password-related operations
- Code review all password handling code
- Test that password not in environment

### RISK-S5: Bitwarden CLI Output Parsing Vulnerabilities

**Category:** Security - Input Validation
**Likelihood:** LOW (10-25%)
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Risk Priority:** LOW

**Description:**
Maliciously crafted vault items could exploit JSON parsing vulnerabilities or inject malicious data into credential objects.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Vault item with JavaScript code in username field
- Vault item with SQL injection in password field
- Vault item with path traversal in domain field
- JSON parsing errors exposing sensitive data

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Input Validation (Implemented):**
   - Validate domain format before vault search
   - Sanitize credential fields before use
   - Validate JSON structure after parsing
   - **Effectiveness:** Prevents injection attacks

2. **Safe JSON Parsing (Implemented):**
   - Use json.loads() (safe by default in Python)
   - Validate expected fields exist before access
   - Handle parse errors gracefully
   - **Effectiveness:** Prevents parsing exploits

3. **No Code Execution from Credentials (Implemented):**
   - Credentials used only for form filling (not eval/exec)
   - Playwright escapes input automatically
   - No shell command construction with credentials
   - **Effectiveness:** Prevents code injection

4. **Vault Trust Model (Assumption):**
   - User's own vault is trusted
   - User responsible for vault content
   - POC doesn't defend against user attacking themselves
   - **Effectiveness:** Acceptable trust assumption for POC

**Residual Risk:** VERY LOW
- Attack requires user to compromise their own vault
- Python and Playwright provide safe input handling
- Not a realistic threat for POC

**Monitoring/Detection:**
- Log parsing errors (without exposing data)
- Validate credential structure after retrieval
- Test with malformed vault items
