## Overview

The Skills System provides specialized domain expertise to agents through modular, reusable skill definitions. Skills are automatically injected into agent prompts, enhancing their capabilities with proven methodologies and best practices.

### What are Skills?

Skills are self-contained knowledge modules that provide:
- **Specific Expertise**: Focused knowledge on a particular domain or technique
- **Proven Methods**: Step-by-step approaches based on best practices
- **Practical Examples**: Concrete code and pattern examples
- **Clear Guidance**: When and how to apply the skill

### Key Benefits

- **Consistency**: All agents use the same proven approaches
- **Quality**: Expertise codified in reusable form
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add domain-specific knowledge
- **Maintainability**: Update skills once, applies to all agents
- **Modularity**: Mix and match skills per agent role

---

## How Skills Work

### 1. Skills Registration

Skills are registered in `.claude/skills/skills.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "skills": [
    {
      "name": "Requirements Elicitation",
      "skill-directory": "requirements-elicitation",
      "category": "analysis",
      "required_tools": ["Read", "Write", "Grep"],
      "description": "Extract and clarify requirements from specifications"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Skills Definition

Each skill has a `SKILL.md` file in its directory:

```
.claude/skills/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements-elicitation/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md         # Complete skill definition
```

The SKILL.md contains:
- YAML frontmatter (metadata)
- Purpose and when to use
- Key capabilities
- Step-by-step approach
- Practical examples
- Best practices

### 3. Agent Assignment

Agents are assigned skills in their frontmatter (`.claude/agents/*.md`):

```markdown
---
name: "Requirements Analyst"
skills: ["requirements-elicitation", "user-story-writing", "bug-triage"]
---
```

### 4. Automatic Injection

When an agent task starts:

1. System reads agent's assigned skills from agents.json
2. Loads each skill's SKILL.md content
3. Builds comprehensive skills section
4. Injects into agent's prompt automatically

**Example injection**:
```
################################################################################
## SPECIALIZED SKILLS AVAILABLE
################################################################################

You have access to the following specialized skills that enhance your capabilities.

## Using Skills

### Viewing Available Skills

```bash
# List all skills
cmat.sh skills list

# Output shows all 14 skills with metadata
```

### Checking Agent Skills

```bash
# See which skills an agent has
cmat.sh skills get requirements-analyst
# Output: ["requirements-elicitation", "user-story-writing", "bug-triage"]

cmat.sh skills get architect
# Output: ["api-design", "architecture-patterns", "desktop-ui-design", "web-ui-design"]

cmat.sh skills get implementer
# Output: ["error-handling", "code-refactoring", "sql-development"]
```

### Reading a Skill

```bash
# Load and view skill content
cmat.sh skills load requirements-elicitation

# Pipe to less for easier reading
cmat.sh skills load api-design | less
```

### Previewing Prompt Injection

```bash
# See complete skills section for an agent
cmat.sh skills prompt requirements-analyst

# Preview what architect receives
cmat.sh skills prompt architect | head -100
```

### Skills in Agent Execution

Skills are automatically used when agents run:

```bash
# Create task (skills auto-injected)
TASK_ID=$(cmat.sh queue add \
  "Analyze requirements" \
  "requirements-analyst" \
  "high" \
  "analysis" \
  "enhancements/feature/feature.md" \
  "Initial analysis")

# Start task (agent receives skills automatically)
cmat.sh queue start $TASK_ID

# Agent's prompt includes:
# - Role definition
# - Task details
# - Skills section (all 3 analysis skills)
# - Source file content
```

### Skills in Agent Output

Agents should document which skills they applied:

**Example from analysis_summary.md**:
```markdown
---
enhancement: my-feature
agent: requirements-analyst
task_id: task_1234567890_12345
timestamp: 2025-10-24T14:30:00Z

```

**Expected Result**: [What should happen]

## Best Practices
- ‚úÖ [Do this]
- ‚ùå Avoid: [Don't do this]
```

### Step 3: Register the Skill

Add to `.claude/skills/skills.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": [
    {
      "name": "My Custom Skill",
      "skill-directory": "my-skill",
      "category": "implementation",
      "required_tools": ["Read", "Write", "Bash"],
      "description": "One-line description matching SKILL.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 4: Assign to Agents

Edit agent frontmatter in `.claude/agents/*.md`:

```markdown
---
name: "Implementer"
skills: ["error-handling", "code-refactoring", "sql-development", "my-skill"]
---
```

### Step 5: Regenerate agents.json

```bash
cmat.sh agents generate-json
```

### Step 6: Test the Skill

```bash
# Verify registration
cmat.sh skills list | grep "my-skill"

# Check agent assignment
cmat.sh skills get implementer
# Should include "my-skill"

# Preview injection
cmat.sh skills prompt implementer | grep -A 20 "My Custom Skill"
```

---

## Managing Skills

### Adding Skills to Agents

Edit the agent's .md file frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: "Requirements Analyst"
skills: ["requirements-elicitation", "user-story-writing", "bug-triage", "new-skill"]
---
```

Then regenerate:
```bash
cmat.sh agents generate-json
```

### Removing Skills from Agents

Edit the agent's .md file frontmatter, remove skill from array, then regenerate.

### Updating Skill Content

Edit the skill's SKILL.md file directly. Changes take effect immediately (no regeneration needed).

### Organizing Custom Skills

**Recommended structure**:
```
.claude/skills/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ skills.json                    # Registry (all skills)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements-elicitation/      # Built-in skills
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ custom-domain-modeling/        # Your custom skills
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ custom-security-review/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ custom-performance-tuning/
```

**Naming conventions**:
- Use lowercase with hyphens
- Be descriptive but concise
- Prefix custom skills with `custom-` to distinguish from built-ins

**DON'T**:
- ‚ùå Make skills too broad or generic
- ‚ùå Include implementation-specific details (those belong in project docs)
- ‚ùå Duplicate content across skills
- ‚ùå Write overly long skills (target 1-2 pages)
- ‚ùå Use jargon without explanation

### Agent Assignment

**DO**:
- ‚úÖ Assign 2-4 skills per agent (not too many)
- ‚úÖ Choose skills directly relevant to agent's role
- ‚úÖ Ensure skills complement each other
- ‚úÖ Consider skill overlap between agents
- ‚úÖ Review assignments periodically

**DON'T**:
- ‚ùå Assign all skills to all agents

### Skill Maintenance

**DO**:
- ‚úÖ Update skills when best practices change
- ‚úÖ Add examples from real project use
- ‚úÖ Incorporate team feedback
- ‚úÖ Version skills.json when making major changes
- ‚úÖ Document skill updates in CHANGELOG

**DON'T**:
- ‚ùå Change skill fundamentals without team review
- ‚ùå Remove skills still in use by agents
- ‚ùå Rename skill directories without updating all references
- ‚ùå Forget to test after major skill updates

### Skill Testing

```bash
# After creating/modifying a skill:

# 1. Test loading
cmat.sh skills load my-skill

# 2. Check agent assignment
cmat.sh skills get implementer

# 3. Preview prompt injection
cmat.sh skills prompt implementer | grep -A 30 "My Skill"

# 4. Run test task
TASK_ID=$(cmat.sh queue add \
  "Test skill" \
  "implementer" \
  "normal" \
  "implementation" \
  "test-file.md" \
  "Testing my-skill")
cmat.sh queue start $TASK_ID

# 5. Verify skill was used
grep "my-skill" enhancements/*/implementer/*.md
```

## Example: Custom Security Skill

Here's a complete example of creating a domain-specific skill:

### 1. Create Directory and File

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/security-audit
```

### 2. Write SKILL.md

**`.claude/skills/security-audit/SKILL.md`**:
```markdown
---
name: "Security Audit"
description: "Systematic security review of code and architecture for common vulnerabilities following OWASP Top 10"
category: "security"
required_tools: ["Read", "Grep", "WebSearch"]
---

# Security Audit

## Purpose
Conduct systematic security reviews to identify vulnerabilities, ensure secure coding practices, and verify compliance with security standards.

## When to Use
- Reviewing authentication/authorization code
- Auditing data handling and storage
- Evaluating API security
- Assessing cryptography usage
- Before production deployment

## Key Capabilities

1. **OWASP Top 10 Assessment** - Check for common web vulnerabilities
2. **Authentication Review** - Validate auth mechanisms
3. **Data Protection** - Ensure sensitive data is protected
4. **Input Validation** - Verify all inputs are sanitized

## Approach

1. **Identify Attack Surface**
   - List all entry points (APIs, forms, uploads)
   - Map data flows
   - Identify trust boundaries

2. **Check OWASP Top 10**
   - Injection flaws (SQL, XSS, etc.)
   - Broken authentication
   - Sensitive data exposure
   - XML external entities
   - Broken access control
   - Security misconfiguration
   - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
   - Insecure deserialization
   - Components with known vulnerabilities
   - Insufficient logging & monitoring

3. **Review Authentication**
   - Password requirements
   - Session management
   - Token generation and validation
   - Multi-factor authentication

4. **Validate Input Handling**
   - All inputs validated
   - Parameterized queries used
   - Output encoding applied
   - File uploads restricted

5. **Check Cryptography**
   - Strong algorithms used (no MD5, SHA1)
   - Proper key management
   - Secure random number generation
   - TLS/SSL configured correctly

6. **Document Findings**
   - Severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Affected components
   - Exploitation risk
   - Remediation steps

## Example

**Context**: Reviewing a user login endpoint

**Security Checklist**:
```python
# ‚ùå VULNERABLE CODE
def login(username, password):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='{username}' AND password='{password}'"
    user = db.execute(query)
    if user:
        session['user_id'] = user.id
        return "Login successful"
    return "Invalid credentials"

# ‚úÖ SECURE CODE
def login(username, password):
    # 1. Input validation
    if not username or not password:
        return "Missing credentials", 400
    
    # 2. Parameterized query (prevents SQL injection)
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password_hash = ?"
    user = db.execute(query, (username, hash_password(password)))
    
    # 3. Secure session management
    if user:
        session.regenerate()  # Prevent session fixation
        session['user_id'] = user.id
        audit_log("login_success", username)
        return "Login successful"
    
    # 4. Generic error (prevents username enumeration)
    audit_log("login_failed", username)
    return "Invalid credentials", 401
```

**Findings**:
- ‚úÖ SQL injection prevented (parameterized query)
- ‚úÖ Password hashing used
- ‚úÖ Session regenerated on login
- ‚úÖ Audit logging present
- ‚úÖ Generic error messages

## Best Practices

- ‚úÖ Always use parameterized queries or ORMs
- ‚úÖ Hash passwords with bcrypt/argon2 (never store plaintext)
- ‚úÖ Validate and sanitize ALL user inputs
- ‚úÖ Use HTTPS for all sensitive operations
- ‚úÖ Implement rate limiting on authentication
- ‚úÖ Log security events
- ‚úÖ Keep dependencies updated
- ‚ùå Avoid: Storing sensitive data in logs
- ‚ùå Avoid: Rolling your own cryptography
- ‚ùå Avoid: Trusting client-side validation alone
```

### 3. Register in skills.json

Add to `.claude/skills/skills.json`:
```json
{
  "skills": [
    {
      "name": "Security Audit",
      "skill-directory": "security-audit",
      "category": "security",
      "required_tools": ["Read", "Grep", "WebSearch"],
      "description": "Systematic security review following OWASP Top 10"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Assign to Security-Reviewer Agent

Create or edit `.claude/agents/security-reviewer.md`:
```markdown
---
name: "Security Reviewer"
description: "Reviews code for security vulnerabilities"
tools: ["Read", "Grep", "WebSearch"]
skills: ["security-audit"]
---
```

### 5. Update Contracts

Add to `.claude/AGENT_CONTRACTS.json`:
```json
{
  "agents": {
    "security-reviewer": {
      "role": "security_review",
      "inputs": {...},
      "outputs": {...},
      "statuses": {...}
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. Test the Skill

```bash
# Generate agents.json
cmat.sh agents generate-json

# Verify skill exists
cmat.sh skills list | grep "security-audit"

# Check agent has skill
cmat.sh skills get security-reviewer

# Preview injection
cmat.sh skills prompt security-reviewer

# Use in workflow
cmat.sh queue add \
  "Security review" \
  "security-reviewer" \
  "critical" \
  "security_review" \
  "enhancements/feature/implementer/test_plan.md" \
  "Review authentication code"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Appearing in List

**Problem**: `cmat.sh skills list` doesn't show my skill

**Solutions**:
```bash
# 1. Check skills.json syntax
jq '.' .claude/skills/skills.json

# 2. Verify skill entry exists
jq '.skills[] | select(.["skill-directory"] == "my-skill")' .claude/skills/skills.json

# 3. Check for typos in skill-directory name
ls .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

### Skill Not Assigned to Agent

**Problem**: Agent doesn't have skill in agents.json

**Solutions**:
```bash
# 1. Check agent .md frontmatter
head -20 .claude/agents/implementer.md

# 2. Verify skills array in frontmatter
grep "^skills:" .claude/agents/implementer.md

# 3. Regenerate agents.json
cmat.sh agents generate-json

# 4. Verify in agents.json
jq '.agents[] | select(.["agent-file"] == "implementer") | .skills' .claude/agents/agents.json
```

### Skill Not in Agent Prompt

**Problem**: Skills section not appearing in agent prompts

**Solutions**:
```bash
# 1. Test skills prompt generation
cmat.sh skills prompt implementer

# If empty output:
# 2. Check agent has skills in agents.json
cmat.sh skills get implementer

# 3. Verify SKILL.md files exist
ls .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md

# 4. Test skills system
cmat.sh skills test
```

### SKILL.md Not Loading

**Problem**: `cmat.sh skills load my-skill` fails

**Solutions**:
```bash
# 1. Verify file exists
ls -la .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

# 2. Check file permissions
chmod 644 .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

# 3. Verify no syntax errors in frontmatter
head -20 .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

# 4. Check directory name matches skills.json
jq -r '.skills[] | .["skill-directory"]' .claude/skills/skills.json | grep my-skill
```

### Skills Not Applied by Agent

**Problem**: Agent output doesn't mention skills used

**Possible Causes**:
1. Skills not relevant to task
2. Agent chose not to apply
3. Task too simple to need skills

**Not a System Error**: Agents decide when to apply skills based on task needs.

## Migration from v2.x

If upgrading from v2.x without skills:

### 1. Verify Skills Exist
```bash
ls .claude/skills/
# Should show: skills.json and skill directories
```

### 2. Check agents.json Has Skills
```bash
jq '.agents[0].skills' .claude/agents/agents.json
# Should show array, not null
```

### 3. Regenerate if Needed
```bash
# If skills missing from agents.json:
cmat.sh agents generate-json
```

### 4. Test System
```bash
cmat.sh skills test
```

### 5. Run Test Task
```bash
# Run demo-test to verify skills injection
TASK_ID=$(cmat.sh queue add \
  "Skills test" \
  "requirements-analyst" \
  "high" \
  "analysis" \
  "enhancements/demo-test/demo-test.md" \
  "Test skills system")

cmat.sh queue start $TASK_ID

# Check logs for skills section
grep -A 10 "SPECIALIZED SKILLS" enhancements/demo-test/logs/*.log
```
